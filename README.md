## What for
It's for me to practise coding skills and Swift understanding.

I failed with Bubble Sort coding challange on my first job interview and decieded to practise algorithms path as much as my Swift path.

## What new I've learned

- [x] Unit Tests

- [x] Bubble Sort
- [x] Linear Search
- [x] FizzBuzz
- [ ] Tree Data Structure
- [ ] Stack Data Structure
- [ ] Queue Data Structure

...

## Requirements
- Xcode 10.3 with latest iOS SDK (12.4)
